This is our implementation of the PCML project 1, the aim is to find Higg's
Boson, or at least to get the closest possible to it. This repository
contains all the code needed to reproduce our best score, but also to
conduct much more experiments, like running any other regression method
than the one we used ourselves.


In order to run this project, you need to:

  1. Put in the same folder as the run.py file, the train and test datasets
  renamed to: "train.csv" and "test.csv"

  2. Run the following command: "python run.py"
  (Assuming you are running python3 as default, otherwise, run
  "python3.5 run.py" instead)

  3. The output predictions will be in the "predictions.csv" file.
